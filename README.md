Modular Chatbots - AMI (Anti-Malaria Intelligence)


Welcome to the future of Chatbot technology! Modular Chatbots features AMI, the Anti-Malaria Intelligence, designed to fight against Malaria in a unique and effective way. Our mission is to create a world where no one dies from this preventable and treatable disease.

About the Project
AMI is a chatbot that provides information and promotes actions to prevent and treat malaria. We are creating an eco-system of modular chatbots to reach out to as many people as possible. Our next exciting development will be a gift shop built on Laravel Jetstream, providing a fun and interactive way to contribute to the cause. We're still in the process of constructing it, so please stay tuned for updates!

How We're Making a Difference


We've partnered with Against Malaria to raise funds for mosquito nets. Every $2 in donations buys one mosquito net. To date, we've raised enough funds to purchase 30 nets! Let's keep the momentum going.

To help us dynamically update the donation status, we're in the process of integrating the donation page directly into our app!
