Cafe Purr WebApp Specification
Overview
"Cafe Purr" is a web-based platform designed to interact with our Natural Language Processing (NLP) platforms, allowing users to create digital art, modify files, generate brainstorming ideas, write grant proposals, and interact with our flagship chatbot, AMI (Anti-Malaria Intelligence). Our goal is to create a community-focused experience that not only provides value to users through their interactions but also allows for monetization and promotion of products or designs created on our platform.
